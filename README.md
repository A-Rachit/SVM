# SVM
A non linear SVM using RKS(Random kitchen sink ) made with cvx in MATLAB
This SVM is made uisng the primal formulaton of SVM whose optimal solution is found using cvx library in MATLAB.

The dataset used to train the model is a Randomly genrated Checkerboard of 2000 point spaning a 5*5 unit square area,
with every alternate cell being part of the same class.

The input space of the model is R^2 and the frature space of the model is R^10.
